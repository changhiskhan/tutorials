Welcome to the Metaflow Tutorials ðŸ‘‹
================

This repository contains the code to follow along with the [Metaflow tutorials](https://outerbounds.com/docs/tutorials-welcome) at outerbounds.com. Metaflow is an open source machine learning infrastructure stack started at [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix). Outerbounds maintains Metaflow and repositories like this so data scientists can focus less on implementation nuance in [the machine learning stack](https://outerbounds.com/blog/the-modern-stack-of-ml-infrastructure) and more on analysis and experimentation.

The tutorials in this repository will teach you how to represent machine learning and data science [workflows as graphs](https://outerbounds.com/docs/dags-in-data-science). You will see benefits of structuring workflows this way like versioning, access to data, and job scheduling on many cloud computers. By engaging in the tutorials, you will learn how to build domain-specific workflows that reliably run locally or in the cloud (with minimal set up). You will see many workflows with composable steps you can mix and match to your unique ML applications. 

Join us on [Slack](http://slack.outerbounds.co/) and let us know how we can support your machine learning journey.

Please consider sharing any cool stuff you build on top of these tutorials!
