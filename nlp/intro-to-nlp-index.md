In this series of episodes, you will learn how to build, train, test and deploy machine learning that performs text-classification.  You will use Tensorflow, Scikit-learn and Metaflow to operationalize a machine learning product using best practices for evaluating and testing.  Lastly, you will learn how you can use this model in downstream processes.


* [Episode 1](./nlp-tutorial-L1): Understanding The Data
* [Episode 2](./nlp-tutorial-L2): Constructing The Model
* [Episode 3](./nlp-tutorial-L3): Setting Up A Baseline Flow
* [Episode 4](./nlp-tutorial-L4): Training Your Model
* [Episode 5](./nlp-tutorial-L5): Evaluating And Testing Your Model
* [Episode 6](./nlp-tutorial-L6): Using Your Model

**Prerequisites**: We assume that you have taken the [introductory tutorials](../docs/intro-tutorial-overview).
